  #Tic-Tac-Toe Demo project

This demo project showcase my coding skills in Python.

Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple two-player game where both the player get to choose any of the symbols between X and O. This game is played on a 3X3 grid board and one by one each player gets a chance to mark its respective symbol on the empty spaces of the grid.
